/*

1) a has-a relationship describes a class containing another class while
an is-a relationship describes a class becoming an extension of an existing
class

2) The word public, then the name of the class, then brackets containing parameters
eg. public test(a, b)
{

}

3) public modifier means it can be accessed by other classes while the private
modifier means it can only be accessed within the class

4) assuming the "2" given to the dot describes the radius of the dot, then the
statement is invalid because you can not change the radius of the dot from
the testing class without calling on a method such as setRadius()

6) An object is a class but a class is not always an object. A class will often
describe an object however a class can also be the testing class which produces
no object.
